Perhaps no other band in history is quite as synonymous with the first names of its members as the Beatles. But at one point, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/george-harrison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Harrison" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Harrison</a> walked out on the band — and at the top of the list to replace him: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/eric-clapton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eric Clapton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eric Clapton</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The guitarist first met the Fab Four when he was in the band the Yardbirds, who were a supporting act for one of their headlining shows in 1964.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That led to a connection so strong that straddled both the Beatles' professional and personal lives. Clapton didn’t just collaborate with the band as a whole, but he also played with each of the four members independently on their solo endeavors. On top of that, he became best friends with Harrison — and they even ended up sharing an ex-wife, Pattie Boyd.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But no matter what happened outside of the music — and even during some of the tense moments inside the recording studio with Harrison, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/john-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Lennon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Lennon</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/paul-mccartney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul McCartney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ringo-starr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ringo Starr" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ringo Starr</a> — they all shared a mutual respect for Clapton, who came close to becoming a Beatle himself.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Harrison used Clapton to help break tension within the Beatles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fittingly, Harrison — the Beatles’ lead guitarist — bonded the most with Clapton, who left the Yardbirds in 1965 and later was part of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos and continues to thrive as a solo artist and one of the greatest guitarists of our time with songs like “Tears in Heaven” and “Wonderful Tonight. (Incidentally, he was replaced in the Yardbirds by two burgeoning guitarists at the time: Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time the Beatles were recording their 1968 self-titled album, also known as The White Album, things were tense among the four. In fact, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beatles-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-739393/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> called it the “album that nearly tore them apart.” Thankfully, they stayed together with Yellow Submarine and Abbey Road following in 1969 and Let It Be in 1970.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When they got to the song “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” they started recording an early “draft” on July 25, 1968, with Harrison playing the guitars and McCartney following along on the harmonium. (The early acoustic take was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beatles-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-739393/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="released in a special edition" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">released in a special edition</a> in 2018.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The song then marinated while they worked on other tracks like the 102 takes of “Not Guilty,” which didn’t make the album. (Eventually, Harrison released it as a solo artist in 1979.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn’t until Harrison invited his best pal Clapton into the studio that they went back to “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.” “Eric played that and I thought it was really good,” Harrison said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beatles-while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-739393/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>. “Then we listened to it back and he said, ‘Ah, there’s a problem, though; it’s not Beatley enough.’ So we put it through the ADT to wobble it up a bit.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Harrison’s true purpose of inviting Clapton? To lessen the tension. “George knew everyone would behave themselves around Clapton — a classic George power move,” the Rolling Stone piece said. “The trick worked — in George’s words, ‘The other guys were as good as gold because he was there.’”</p><img alt="Eric Clapton (in the white suit,) Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen Cox and George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at Heathrow Airport, in London on June 26, 1968" title="Eric Clapton (in the white suit,) Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen Cox and George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at Heathrow Airport, in London on June 26, 1968" width=4060 height=4066 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-953843258.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Eric Clapton (in the white suit,) Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen Cox and George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at Heathrow Airport, in London on June 26, 1968.; Photo: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Lennon wrote Clapton a letter as a plea to work together</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But things didn’t pan out so smoothly when they were back in the studio in 1969. Even though it was after the band’s famous 1968 transcendental meditation trip in India, tempers flared and on January 10, Harrison walked out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I’m out of here. Put an ad in [the papers] and get a few people in. See you ’round the clubs,” he said as he packed up his guitar, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-the-beatles-broke-up-113403/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While they continued working — with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/yoko-ono data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yoko Ono" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Yoko Ono</a> stepping in for Harrison’s vocals — Lennon’s fear of the future burst out: “The point is, George leaves, and do we want to carry on as the Beatles? I certainly do.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He immediately suggested Clapton.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the actual reaction of the rest of the band is unknown, Clapton never went on to record with the Beatles (and wasn’t officially acknowledged for his work on The White Album track) — the Fab Four ended up dissolving over the course of the next couple of years as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But in one desperate plea — documented in a 1971 letter — Lennon did reach out to Clapton. “Eric, I know I can bring out something great, in fact greater in you that had been so far evident in your music. I hope to bring out the same kind of greatness in all of us, which I know will happen if/when we get together,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-johnlennon-auction/rare-john-lennon-letter-to-eric-clapton-up-for-auction-idUSBRE8A41HJ20121105 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the letter reads" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the letter reads</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In another passage, scribbled on page 8, it appears to say: “At least think about it, please don’t be frightened. I understand paranoia only too well. I think it could only do good for you to work with people who love and respect you and that’s from all of us. Lots of love to you both from John + Yoko.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While it’s unclear who the “all of us” refers to, the letter was from 1971 and the Beatles had officially broken up in 1970.</p><img alt="The letter John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote to Eric Clapton about forming a group together, dated September 29, 1971" title="The letter John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote to Eric Clapton about forming a group together, dated September 29, 1971" width=4180 height=2668 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-157463226.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">The letter John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote to Eric Clapton about forming a group together, dated September 29, 1971.; Photo: STAN HONDA/AFP via Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Clapton eventually collaborated with some of the Beatles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even after they all went their separate ways, each of the former Beatles showed their respect for Clapton’s talents <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/exploring-eric-claptons-collaborations-george-harrison-and-beatles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="with their individual solo projects" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">with their individual solo projects</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lennon called on Clapton, as well as Starr, for 1969’s “Cold Turkey,” written by Ono, and released under the Plastic Ono Band. Starr later teamed up with the guitarist for his 1976 “This Be Called a Song” (which Clapton wrote) and decades later on “Never Without You” in 2003. McCartney teamed up with him on the 9/11 tribute song “Freedom” in 2001, as well as this decade with “My Valentine” — and McCartney returned the favor, providing backing vocals on Clapton’s 2013 “All of Me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJonKuhk2Kwra3PraanZaSdsm6uxJqrpZ2j</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feric-clapton-the-beatles.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sidney-sedin-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sidney-sedin-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Sidney Sedin Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mythlogic-callisto-1512-clevo-w550eu-ultrabook-review.html>In and Around the Mythlogic Callisto 1512</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mythlogic-callisto-1512-clevo-w550eu-ultrabook-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
