The No. 3 pick in the 2009 NBA draft, he began his career with the Oklahoma City Thunder before a stunning trade to the Houston Rockets in 2012. Harden has since emerged as a perennial MVP candidate and one of the top scorers in NBA history, ranking 25th all-time as of November 2023. Among his most notable accomplishments are a record-setting 60-point triple-double in a January 2018 game, as well as 23 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/50-point-game-most-times.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="career 50-point games" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">career 50-point games</a>—fourth most in NBA history behind <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/wilt-chamberlain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wilt Chamberlain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wilt Chamberlain</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/michael-jordan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Jordan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Jordan</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/kobe-bryant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kobe Bryant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kobe Bryant</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: James Edward Harden Jr.<br>BORN: August 26, 1989<br>BIRTHPLACE: Los Angeles, California<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Early Years" data-anchor-id=early-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James Edward Harden Jr. was born on August 26, 1989, in Los Angeles. James Sr., a former Navy seaman, was mostly absent from his life, leading to Harden and his two siblings to be raised by their mom, Monja Willis, in the city’s Compton neighborhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time James first tried out for the boys’ basketball team at Artesia High School in nearby Lakewood, he stood a relatively modest 6 feet, 1 inch, and was hampered by bouts of asthma. However, he immediately impressed his coaches with his game instincts, and after sprouting a few inches, he became one of the top players in the nation. Harden led Artesia to back-to-back state championships and was named a McDonald’s All-American in 2007.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="College Career at Arizona State" data-anchor-id=college-career-at-arizona-state class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">College Career at Arizona State</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the most decorated recruits in Arizona State basketball history, Harden immediately helped turn around a program that sunk to an 8-22 record in 2006-07. The Sun Devils improved to 21 wins during Harden’s freshman season and surged to 25 wins and a berth in the NCAA Tournament by his third and final year. Named the Pac-10 Conference Player of the Year and an All-American, he wrapped up his collegiate career ranked third all-time in ASU’s record book with an average of 19.0 points per game. Later, Arizona State retired his No. 13 jersey.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Learn About Other NBA Stars</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 title="NBA Teams" data-anchor-id=nba-teams class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">NBA Teams</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harden has been in the NBA since the 2009-10 season and currently plays for the Los Angeles Clippers.

He earned the first of six straight All-Star berths that year and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player in 2015 and 2017 before finally claiming the trophy in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For all his individual brilliance, Harden was unable to push the Rockets past the pack of postseason contenders in his first few years with the team. Houston did reach the Western Conference Finals in 2015 but was bounced in the first round of the playoffs in 2016. The following year, another promising season halted in the playoffs’ second round.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/chris-paul data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chris Paul" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chris Paul</a> bringing his veteran leadership to the team, and key role players like Eric Gordon fitting nicely alongside Harden in his prime, the Rockets won an NBA-best 65 games in 2017-18, before suffering a heartbreaking loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. The following year, Harden lifted Houston out of an early hole with his unstoppable scoring ability, but the season again ended at the hands of the Warriors in the playoffs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harden won his third-straight scoring title with Houston in the 2019-20 season, which was suspended on March 11, 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and resumed later that summer in a contained “bubble” at the Walt Disney World resort in Florida.

In February 2022, Brooklyn traded the superstar to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a package including draft picks as well as young point guard Ben Simmons. The Sixers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs with Harden for two years in a row.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Trade to the Los Angeles Clippers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2023, Harden exercised his player option with Philadelphia worth $35.6 million. However, he became vocal in his criticism of the team’s front office, calling Daryl Morey—now the Sixers’ president of basketball operations—a liar and requesting a trade. Harden missed media day and the opening day of training camp, then didn’t suit up in Philadelphia’s first three games in late October.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early morning of October 31, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1719233117100142839 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ESPN reported" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ESPN reported</a> that Philadelphia agreed to trade Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers for a package that included four players and multiple draft selections.
