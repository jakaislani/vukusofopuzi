That wasn't a Vasto Lorde though. It was an artificial tracking Hollow called "White". The reason it was so strong is because it was made from Shinigami souls rather than human souls, which are much stronger on average.<h2>Is Ichigo immortal?</h2>Although Ichigo has an ability to endure combat situations that nearly no other soul reaper could, mainly because of the hollowfied Ichigo living within him.
