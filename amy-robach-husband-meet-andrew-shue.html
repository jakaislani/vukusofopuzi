Robach stands at a height of 5 feet inches and weighs 54kg.</p><p>Before relocating to St. Louis, Missouri, <a href=#>Robach</a> was born and raised in East Lansing, Michigan. She attended high school and college in Georgia, where her family relocated once again.</p><p>She earned high honors in broadcast journalism at the University of Georgia after graduating from Brookwood High School in Snellville, Georgia. She finished as Miss Georgia 1995’s fourth runner-up.</p><p><a href=#>Robach</a> began working for WCBD in 1995. Then, in 1999, <a href=#>Robach</a></p>left the station and began working at WTTG in Washington, D.C. She later moved to MSNBC, where she worked for four years, including a time when she was the morning anchor for two hours and a substitute on Weekend Today, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and Morning Joe.<p>In July 2007, she was appointed as Weekend Today’s co-anchor. On May 19, 2012, she announced she will be leaving Weekend Today and joining ABC News.</p><p><a href=#>Robach </a>debuted as a correspondent on ABC’s Good Morning America.&nbsp;As of March 31, 2014, she was the newscaster for the program. 2018 saw Robach take over as 20/20’s co-anchor.</p><p>In place of Strahan, Sara & Keke, <a href=#>Robach</a> began hosting Epidemic: What You Need To Know on ABC in March 2020. The daily program first focused on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.</p><p>Later, GMA3: What You Need To Know took over for Strahan, Sara & Keke, and <a href=#>Robach</a></p>remained the host. On November 2, 2019, Project Veritas published a “hot mic” incident from late August 2019 in which <a href=#>Robach </a>talked about how ABC cut off her 2015 report on the wealthy, convicted sex offender and suspected sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.<p>Only two days before, an NPR report had revealed the existence of an on-camera interview with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and ABC’s failure to air it. That story was followed by <a href=#>Robach’s</a> remarks. Giuffre claims that Epstein trafficked her for sex to influential individuals like Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a claim that the Duke has vehemently refuted.</p><p><a href=#>Robach </a>announced on Good Morning America on November 11, 2013, that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer following follow-up testing and a mammography she had on live television on October 1, 2013.</p><p>She took a break from her television duties to have bilateral mastectomy surgery. On November 22, 2013, <a href=#>Robach</a> announced that the disease had spread to her lymph nodes and that a second malignant tumor had been discovered in her other breast during the surgery (classified as Stage IIB).</p><p>After that, she had eight rounds of radiation, chemotherapy, and reconstructive surgery. <a href=#>Robach</a> had no evidence of cancer as of March 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Amy Robach husband: Meet Andrew Shue</h2><p><a href=#>Amy Robach</a> is currently married to Andrew Shue.
