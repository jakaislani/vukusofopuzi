They had a very quick rise. What was a little different, or at least seemingly from the outside is once Keegs killed them it really went down, so it looked like the Barstool audience was largely their audience.

I texted them, I tried to talk to them in person. I briefly talked to the Alex.”</p><p>“If they wanted to stay, they would stay,” she said, to which Portnoy replied: “You made her life miserable, she didn’t want to come in.”</p><p>Keegs claimed she told the Bennett and Woodruff that the whole situation was “blown out of proportion,” and asked them to talk outside of Barstool, off-camera, but they refused.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kelly Keegs at the 2023 Barstool Awards. <span class=credit>Instagram/Kelly Keegs</span></figure><p>Portnoy then joked that Keegs had a “kill list.”</p><p>“Keegs killed them,” he said. “They did not want to be in the office.
