It sounds like he might be ill again, so I would return to the vet to have him checked.</span></span><h2>Why is my guinea pig's hair sticking up?</h2>Guinea pigs can stretch/compress themselves a considerable amount. When fully stretched, they look thinner and their hair looks flatter because it is spread over a larger area. When they shorter themselves completely, they look plumper and their hair tends to stick up because there's not room for it to lie flat.<h2>How do you know if your guinea pig is happy?</h2>A happy guinea pig<p>A good appetite and enthusiasm for food. Plenty of activity (not at all lethargic) “Popcorning” (when a guinea pig leaps into the air with happiness) Lots of communication in the form of their various vocalizations, including “wheeking” and other squeaks, whistles, and purring sounds.</p><h2>Why does guinea pig lift their head up when I pet him?</h2>When a guinea pig wants you to stop stroking them on their head, they will suddenly lift their head up, in the hope that they can remove your hand. Please be respectful when they do this and don't carry on petting them on their head.<h2>How do you know if your guinea pig hates you?</h2><p>If you're a new guinea pig owner, then you've likely experienced the feeling that that your pet hates you.<br>...<br>5. Take Biting Personally</p><ul><li>Your hands smell like food. Cavies have sensitive noses! ...</li><li>It's time for a bathroom break. Piggies like to pee every 10-15 minutes. ...</li><li>Mishandling.</li></ul><h2>Guinea Pig Sounds and What They Mean</h2><p></p><h2>What does a sad guinea pig sound like?</h2>Teeth chattering, hissing, growling, and whining are all some unhappy guinea pig sounds that your guinea pig may make when they are in discomfort with another piggie.<h2>How do you cheer up a sad guinea pig?</h2>Try to keep food dishes, water bottles, houses, and toys away from the walls of the cage so that your guinea pig has lots of space to run and play. Place all cage accessories in the centre of the cage to create a perimeter around the cage that is free of obstructions for your guinea pig to run around.<h2>Why does my guinea pig flatten out when I pet her?</h2>Guinea pigs lay flat because they feel safe and comfortable enough with you and their surroundings, and they just want to lay still and relax for a while. Most of the time there's no problem with a guinea pig lying down flat because it just shows that it's peaceful enough for them to be able to relax out in the open.<h2>How many times a day should I hold my guinea pig?</h2>Most guinea pigs love spending quality time with their owners, so handling them is enjoyable for all concerned. Once your guinea pig gets to know you, being hand-fed and petted become important parts of their lives. This means it's actually up to you how much you hold them - you can do so as often as you like.<h2>Do guinea pigs laugh?</h2>Admittedly it sounds like a laugh but it is not a response to humour. Similarly, guinea pigs are known to 'chuckle' and when parrots 'laugh' they are merely immitating sounds they have previously heard.<h2>How do guinea pigs show love?</h2>A guinea pig might also lick their person's fingers/hand, which can be a sign of affection — after all, that's how guinea pigs show affection to one another. Or the guinea pig might just like the taste of a person's skin.<h2>How can you tell if your guinea pig is depressed?</h2>Normally, a stressed guinea pig will show signs of irritability and more aggressive displays of behavior, such as head tossing, fidgeting, or teeth-baring. A depressed guinea pig, on the other hand, will become very listless and not display much energy.<h2>Do guinea pigs cry?</h2>So, although we wouldn't consider guinea pigs to cry 'emotional tears', like all mammals their eyes do produce physical tears. This is to keep their eye moist and clean.<h2>Why do guinea pigs stare at you?</h2>Guinea pigs often stare at people because they want attention. Perhaps piggies need to be cuddled, pet, or you should bring them a toy. They behave this way if they're used to being around humans and have bonded with their owners.<h2>Do guinea pigs know when you're crying?</h2>Piggies are known to respond to their owners crying in particular, whether or not you're loud and frantic. If you're crying, your guinea pig may watch you intently with what can best be described as a concerned or worried facial expression. In some cases, guinea pigs may even hurry to your side while you cry.<h2>Do guinea pigs understand words?</h2>Consistency is Key! It takes time, patience, and skill to TEACH guinea pigs to understand and respond to a human vocabulary. Possible vocabulary words: Sit, Shake, Take It, Drop It, Sit-Up, Kennel, Rub Noses, Jump, Under, Over, On Top, Mat, Fetch.<h2>How do guinea pigs talk?</h2>Guinea pigs are sociable, chatty creatures who generally have plenty to say, using around 11 different noises to communicate how they're feeling. In fact, guinea pigs use sounds as a primary means of communication and, since they are herd animals, sounds are also their means of maintaining social rank.<h2>Why is my guinea pig squeaking when I pet him?</h2>Squeal: Some guinea pigs will squeal when they are experiencing potential pain or they need attention. It can sometimes be that another guinea pig is stealing his favorite spot to eat. Pay attention to your guinea pig if you hear a squeal because it could indicate that they need help from something hurting them.<h2>Do guinea pigs enjoy music?</h2>Do Guinea Pigs like music? Yes, Guinea pigs have been found to enjoy certain types of music played at a soft volume. There have been many studies on the topic of what music is best for guinea pigs to listen to. Most people agree that classical music or soft jazz, in particular, might be good choices.<h2>What do guinea pigs love the most?</h2><p>What Do Guinea Pigs Like To Play With?

You can just enjoy the smell of fresh hay and vegetables, although you can bet the piggies will be loving that kind of smell even more than you!<h2>What is toxic to guinea pigs?</h2>Make sure you do not feed your guinea pigs the following foods (this is not an exhaustive list): cereals; grains; nuts; seeds; dried beans, corn, and peas; buttercups; garden shrubs (such as hemlock or privet); lilies of any kind; sweet peas; nightshade; oak; avocado; onion grass; onions; potato tops; mushrooms; ...<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1llKSytHnIrWSmnZGjeri0xKdkmmWXqravscBmp6Kfo2K1orXRZqqtoZOgwG7Bzw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-it-mean-when-a-guinea-pigs-hair-sticks-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-qualifies-for-irs-fresh-start.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-qualifies-for-irs-fresh-start.html>Who qualifies for IRS Fresh Start?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-last-of-robin-hood-2014.html>The Last of Robin Hood movie review (2014)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-last-of-robin-hood-2014.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
