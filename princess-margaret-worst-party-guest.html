The singer was appalled, both by this trivializing of her talent and by the Princess’s lordly tone. “Go and tell that nasty, rude little princess that we’ve known each other for long enough and gabbed in enough ladies’ rooms that she should skip the ho-hum royal routine and just pop over here and ask me herself,” said Garland. “Tell her I’ll sing if she christens a ship first.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Margaret also met her match in the iconic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elizabeth-taylor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Taylor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, who seemed to have been amused by Margaret’s continued slights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“After <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/richard-burton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Burton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Burton</a> presented Taylor with the huge Krupp Diamond, Princess Margaret remarked to a friend that it was ‘the most vulgar thing I’ve ever seen,’” Brown writes in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret</a>. “Taylor heard of this slight. A while later, the two women met at a party. Taylor was wearing the diamond and asked Margaret if she would like to try it on. Margaret slipped it on her finger. ‘Doesn’t look so vulgar now, does it?’ observed Taylor.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the end of one particularly tense party in London in the early 1980s, which included an embarrassing episode where the Princess recited the lines from Taylor’s current play, she finally looked at the good-natured movie star dismissively <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="and said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">and said</a>, “Is anyone going to take her home – or we’ll have to find a sleeping bag?!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This was quite a statement for a woman legendary for overstaying her welcome. The critic Brian Sewell described a stay with her at a friend’s house in the country, where <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she took advantage of the protocol" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she took advantage of the protocol</a> that no one could retire before Her Royal Highness:</p>The Princess arrived an hour before midnight for a ruined dinner scheduled for eight; by then the servants from the village had gone home to bed and the rest of us, some half-dozen, absolutely plastered, had to buckle-to, and carry and carve the baked meats of sacrifice; she then kept us up until four in the morning, kippering us with her cigarettes. Long after the crack of dawn, with not a sniff of coffee nor sign of a servant in the kitchen to clear the mess from the night, I wandered into the village, called a friend and arranged a late morning death-and-doomsday telephone message requiring my immediate return home.<h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The princess was very particular and expected everyone to cater to her—even the queen</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Margaret constantly kept her exhausted hosts on edge. She was legendarily picky – she only drank bottled Malvern water and openly disparaged her hosts’ carefully prepared dishes. As Brown notes, she seemed to delight in making her superiority evident at all times. “We were going to drive from Royal Lodge to the Castle,” journalist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Selina Hastings recalled" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Selina Hastings recalled</a>. “She was wearing some peep-toe sandals and as she got into the car she said, ‘Selina, I’ve got some chewing gum on my shoe!’ So, I had to get out and go round to the other side and pull the chewing gum off.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nowhere was the Princess more catered to than the private island of Mustique, owned by her great friend Colin Tennant. From the 1970s until her death, Mustique was her private party fiefdom. Tennant even supplied bowls of fresh water to wash the sand off her feet after her daily swim. “He collapsed with exhaustion when Princess Margaret left the island,’ the actor Nicholas Courtney <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Brown" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Brown</a>. “He put every ounce of energy into making it fun for her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even her loving and understanding sister found Margaret an exacting and maddening guest. After scalding her feet in Mustique in 1999, the princess often used a wheelchair, though her sister thought it unnecessary. During a visit to Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth had only supplied a wheelchair for the nonagenarian <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-mother-elizabeth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Mother" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Mother</a>, much to Margaret’s dismay. “The Queen had seen to it that a footman would have a wheelchair ready for her mother,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374906047 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brown writes" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Brown writes</a>, “but as the lift doors opened onto the first floor, Margaret made a dash for it. ‘For God’s sake, Margaret – get out! That’s meant for Mummy!’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the end of her life, Margaret was considered so unpleasant that officials at Sotheby’s were literally bribing fellow guests to chat with her for five minutes.

Hoity-toity is what was wanted. For most recipients, hosts, and guests, once she had finally gone and the dust had settled, they were left with a suitably outrageous story.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e8%2BroKeblajAbrnAq56aqpWperi70ayrZqiRp8G6ecaunKys</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprincess-margaret-worst-party-guest.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alek-manoah-parents-and-family-everything-to-know-about-the-baseball-player.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alek-manoah-parents-and-family-everything-to-know-about-the-baseball-player.html>Alek Manoah Parents And Family: Everything To Know About The Baseball player</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-the-best-sandwich-at-ikes-html.html>What is the best sandwich at Ikes?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-the-best-sandwich-at-ikes-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
